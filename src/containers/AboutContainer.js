          Once upon a time, in Canada, there was a bored software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
          Every day, after very long hours spent coding different projects, sometimes for his dreams software, 
            most of the times his nightmares (we all need money, right ?!), he would watched a movie and try to escape his mind.
  
          </p>
          <p>
          Finally he got bored by the so-called "Original" productions from big streaming names and decided to look elsewhere, precisely, in the Public Domain Movies.

          </p>
          <p>
          He tried Archive.org and they had a priceless collection of what he wanted to watch, but their UI was not as bling bling as he was used to, so he decided to take a few days and build CineDantan.com
